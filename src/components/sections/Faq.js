      <p>
        FemmeHacks is a 2-day long event for women, non-binary folks, and historically
        underrepresented groups to form teams, brainstorm an idea, and build it into execution.

        This year, FemmeHacks will take place on February 11th-12th, 2022. Because of

        Any women-identifying or non-binary folk can attend FemmeHacks, regardless of

      <p>
        Absolutely. FemmeHacks is specificlaly made to be beginner-friendly â€“ plenty of
        our previous hackers have come in without any coding knowledge. We host plenty of
        beginner-friendly workshops, such as Introduction to Web Development (HTML/CSS) and
        Introduction to Python, to teach our hackers coding from scratch.
        We also have plenty of mentors to help you during the hackathon itself.

        Yes! Weâ€™ll have team formation and ideation workshops to help you find
        great people to work with on an idea that excites you. Many past attendees
        have formed teams or brainstormed ideas during the hackathon â€“ we encourage you to
        register regardless!
