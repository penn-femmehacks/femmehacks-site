          <h3>What is FemmeHacks?</h3>
          <p>Now running on our 8th year, FemmeHacks is a two-day collegiate hackathon
            hosted at the University of Pennsylvania by the universityâ€™s Women in Computer
            Science chapter. FemmeHacks aims to <b>empower</b>, <b>educate</b>, and <b>inspire </b>
            women and non-binary folks across the nation. After forming teams,
            attendees build a variety of web, mobile, and hardware applications, learn from
            workshops, and attend various speaker events. This year, FemmeHacks will be held
            virtually. </p>

          <h3>Why attend FemmeHacks?</h3>
          {/* Can change workshop topics to this year's once we know them */}
          <p>FemmeHacks is committed to education â€” weâ€™ve hosted workshops on all sorts of topics,
            including GitHub, web development, iOS development and computer graphics. FemmeHacks also
            gives attendees the opportunity to connect with other women and non-binary people in the
            general tech community. Last year, over <b>87% of our attendees</b> said they made at least one valuable
            connection with a fellow student or mentor! We also have free swag for all attendees and
            company-sponsored prizes for hackathon winners. </p>
